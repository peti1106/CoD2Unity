# Current status
This Unity project can currently load D3DBSP and IWI files from the games' IWD files. It's only been tested on Call of Duty 2, and only on multiplayer maps (maps with the mp_ prefix).

The original creator did not have any intention of creating a remake of Call of Duty 2, and he did not implement any type of multiplayer or FPS mechanics. But my goal for me is to create some kind of basic multiplayer game and also learn about reverse engineering and game mechanics.

Check the project tab for my future plans.

I am accepting any pull requests introducing new features and also bug fixes and performance improvements.
